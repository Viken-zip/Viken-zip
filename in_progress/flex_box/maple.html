            <p>Maple (メイプル Meipuru?) is a prideful, quick-thinking, and often arrogant catgirl. She loves the latest brand-name products and purrs only when she wants something from Shigure. She typically speaks frankly, yet remains attentive to those around her. She is, as the saying goes, a scaredy-cat, always turning on every light on the way to the bathroom at night. Out of all the catgirls, her tongue is the most sensitive to hot things.</p>

                        <h1>Appearance:</h1>
                        <p>
                            Maple has orange, back-length wavy hair and her eyes are dark green. True to her breed as an American Curl, she has curled ears, and a matching fluffy tail.

                            <br>
                            Her standard attire consists of a brown headband in her hair, a ruffled buttoned white sleeved t-shirt covered with a brown waistcoat which appears to be plaid on the underside, a matching plaid skirt, with brown knee socks and black heeled slip-on shoes. She wears her gold bell around her neck adorned with a red ribbon.

                        <h1>Personality:</h1>
                        <p>
                            Maple is presented as the most independent and mature of the Minaduki catgirls, showing herself off as being refined yet at times haughty. She is extremely prideful, although her pride has at times been her downfall, as shown when buying her first guitar with Kashou which required his intervention to rescue her from herself.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Maple appears to be more self aware and more ambitious than the other catgirls. In Vol 3 she reveals that she aspires to be a singer, although her own lack of self confidence holds her back. She has a particular dislike for the term "catgirl", since she felt people who refer to her as one didn't view her as an individual, but rather as just a catgirl.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            She is extremely scared of the dark, a fact which she hates being brought up by the other catgirls.
