            <p>Vanilla (バニラ Banira?) is a clever and quiet catgirl who loves Chocola. She is Chocola’s twin sister and the youngest among the Minaduki catgirls. Vanilla is prone to be misunderstood because she rarely expresses her emotions. In fact, she is quite smart and often makes some remarkable insights. Her sharp wit and I’ll-do-things-my-way attitude make her Chocola’s complete opposite. However, she remains both kind-hearted and, well, catlike.</p>

                        <p>
                            In contrast to her twin Chocola, Vanilla's ears, tail and hair are primarily white with a subtle pink undertone. She has blue eyes which are often slightly squinted, and her hair is tied up and styled as twin tails supported by a blue ribbon strand.

                            <br>
                            Her usual attire consists of a light blue and navy blue lolita-style dress with white shin-length socks with garter trims and blue Mary Jane shoes. She wears two large blue ribbons; one on the top of her head and one on her collar. Her left hand is lightly wrapped around with a blue string and she wears a small garter near the tip of her tail.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After she passes her independent catgirl training, she receives a gold bell that is placed on her collar ribbon.

                        <h1>Personality:</h1>
                        <p>
                            Vanilla is quiet, calm and very stoic. She rarely expresses her emotions, making her a somewhat of a kūdere character, as opposed to her sister's energetic, playful personality. She loves her twin sister Chocola and will accompany her always due to her sis-con-like relationship towards her.
