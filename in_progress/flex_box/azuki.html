            <p>Azuki (アズキ Azuki?) is the eldest of the Minaduki catgirls. She is fearless and easygoing. Azuki never hides her nature. She’s not afraid to voice her mind, often with a few uncouth words. Most tasks are a nuisance to her at best, leaving her with little motivation to do anything. She is actually quite capable, though, and can do almost anything if put to work (aside from physical labor). She has a complex about her body size, however. Never, ever mention “short legs” around her.</p>

                        <p>
                            Contrary to her age, Azuki is the second shortest of the Minaduki catgirls as well as the most youthful in appearence due to her Munchkin traits; this is in stark contrast to Coconut who is the third youngest, but appears to be one of the oldest. She has brown neck-length hair tied up by two cat-themed hair clips into small twin tails on the opposite sites of her head. She has brown eyes, and a striped tail.

                            <br>
                            Her casual attire consists of a Sailor suit-style white sleeveless buttoned shirt with blue collar and a red ascot. She wears a blue pleated skirt, and black Mary Jane shoes with white ankle socks. Her gold bell is hung from a red choker around her neck.

                        <h1>Personality:</h1>
                        <p>
                            Azuki is one of the most responsible of the Minaduki catgirls, often acting as their supervisor when helping to run La Soleil. However her brash personality often sees her come to blows with her sisters, in particular Coconut. Deep down however, she cares about her family and their well-being, and checks on them even if she previously had a fight with them.

                            Azuki's fatal flaw is that she has trouble expressing her emotions or desires, which she hides behind her tsundere façade. Both Coconut and Vanilla have demonstrated the ability to see through this trait, at times forcing her to become honest with herself.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After becoming Kashou's catpanion, she actively attempts to become more honest, this in turn causes her to get into less fights with her sisters.
