            <p>Chocola (ショコラ Shokora?) is a cheerful and straightforward catgirl with a dog-like personality who is very fond of her master. She is Vanilla’s twin sister and the youngest among the Minaduki catgirls. She’s not good at dealing with complicated stuff, but she is always friendly and energetic. She tends to leap into action before fully thinking things through. Despite her clumsy moments, her go-getter attitude earns plenty of love from everybody around her.</p>

                            Chocola has long brunette hair in two twintails with two small ribbons a top her head, matching her red and white dress, with stockings and pink shoes, brighter than the other colors she wears.

                            She receives a silver colored Bell although it is not mentioned what corresponding rank or status comes with the color a catgirl obtains after taking her bell exam.

                        <h1>Personality:</h1>
                        <p>
                            Chocola is a cheerful and energetic Catgirl as Kashou himself describes her, 'happy-go-lucky'. She doesn't usually get upset, and even when she does, she often swings back to being as cheery as usual, though occasionally she can be genuinely sad about something. She is curious, and has a childlike outlook on things, which is fitting as she and Vanilla are mentioned to be only 9 months old in human terms.
